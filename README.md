# LightAlarm
LightAlarm is a silent alarm, using LEDs to wake you up.
## How It Works
It works by using LEDs that will slowly increase in brightness, 
until about 20 seconds before the alarm is set to go off. Then
the LEDs will dramitcally increase in brightness, ideally waking you up.
If you don't wake up and stop the alarm 20 seconds
